## Fall 2025 Contributions

**Data Packaging and SPI Communication**

    - `spi_new_test.cpp`: Creates test data, packages it into a protobuf header, and performs a SPI transfer from the RPI to the ESP32
            - This is the outline for future data transfer, but needs to be updated so the protobuf data is set to the generated output from the physics engine. `
    
    - `../shared/sensor_data.proto` defines the fields to package sensor data for transfer to the testnode
    
    - `../../testnode/.../spi_slave_protobuf.c`: Code for the esp32 side of the SPI communication

**Flight sim**

    - For now i just compile with g++ -std=c++17 main.cpp physics/*.cpp -Iphysics -I/Users/[path]/cpp_libraries/eigen-master -o main then ./main
